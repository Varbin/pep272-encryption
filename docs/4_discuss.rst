This section provides in-depth knowledge of topics important in the context
of the library.

Block cipher mode of operation
------------------------------

Block ciphers can be used in different modes of operation.
The mode of operation can be set by passing one of the constants
to the cipher object.
Different modes of operation may require to pass extra
arguments to the constructor.

PEP-272_ requires libraries to provide at least the most common modes: 
``ECB``, ``CBC``, ``CFB``, ``OFB`` and ``CTR``, all of those are supported
by this library.

Each mode of operation is different and has different requirements.

.. warning::
    All of the supported modes of operating do not protect the integrity of encrypted data!

.. _PEP-272: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0272/

Electronic Code Book Mode (ECB)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ECB mode of operation is the simplest one - each plaintext block is 
independently encrypted. The resulting problem is that the same plaintext
leads to the same ciphertext, every time they occur. This means ECB mode
is not `semantically secure`_.

Plain- / ciphertexts must be multiple of blocksize in length.

.. _semantically secure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_security

The formulae for the ECB mode are:

.. math::
 
   C_{i}=E_{K}(P_{i})

   P_{i}=D_{K}(C_{i})

Attacks against ECB mode
************************

Because all plaintext blocks are encrypted independently, an encryption
of the same block results in the same ciphertext block each time.

This means by having multiple ciphertexts in can be concluded whether the 
correspondent plaintexts are the same or not.

The multiple repetition of plaintext blocks may result in visible repetitions
in the ciphertext, e.g. in images.

Cipher Block Chaining Mode (CBC)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To solve the problems of the ECB mode, a plaintext block is xored_ to the
previous ciphertext block. For the very "first" ciphertext an 
**initialization vector (IV)** is used. The IV can be considered public
information.

Plain- / ciphertexts must be multiple of blocksize in length.

Having an incorrect block or IV will result in an incorrect decryption of
the direct adjectant block, but the remaining blocks will remain intact.

The formulae for en- and decryption are:

.. math::
 
   C_{i}=E_{K}(P_{i} \oplus C_{i-1})

   P_{i}=D_{K}(C_{i}) \oplus C_{i-1}

   C_0 = \mbox{IV}

Attacks against CBC mode
************************

A one-bit change  to the ciphertext causes complete corruption of the 
corresponding block of plaintext, and the inversion of the corresponding bit
in the next block while leaving the rest iof the blocks intact. This can lead
to `padding oracle attacks`_ such as POODLE_ (it is the consequence solely
of the choice of CBC mode but other design choices, too).

`Watermarking attacks`_ are possible with predictable IVs.

Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The CFB mode of operation makes a stream cipher out of the block cipher. The 
block size of the cipher is reduced to ``segment_size``.

Plain- and ciphertext must be a multiple of ``segment_size`` in length.

The formulae describing CFB mode are:

.. math::

   C_{i}=E_{K}(C_{i-1})\oplus P_{i}

   P_{i}=E_{K}(C_{i-1})\oplus C_{i}

   C_{0}=\mbox{IV}

Output Feedback (OFB)
+++++++++++++++++++++

OFB mode creates a stream cipher by XORing_ the plain text with a keystream
generated by encrypting a stream of null bytes in CBC mode. Encryption
and decryption are the same, data of arbitrary length can be processed.

The initialization vector **must** be unique, or there will be a catastrophic cryptographic failure.

The formulae describing OFB mode of operation are:

.. math::

   C_{i} = P_{i} \oplus O_{i}

   P_{i} = C_{i} \oplus O_{i}


   O_{i} = E_{K} (O_{i-1} \oplus O_{i} )

   O_{0}=\mbox{IV}

Counter mode of operation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

CTR mode creates a stream cipher by XORing_ the plain text with a keystream
generated by encrypting a counter.
Encryption and decryption are the same, data of arbitrary length can be processed.

The counter **must never** repeat, or there will be a catastrophic cryptographic failure.

CTR can be described with those formulae:

.. math::

   C_{i} = P_{i} \oplus O_{i}

   P_{i} = C_{i} \oplus O_{i}

where :math:`O_{i}` are the return values of the counter.

Speed
-----

As a large part of this library is written in pure python, it is slower than C implementations,
like PyCrypto and its successor PyCryptodome.

The presence of the optional C extension significantly improves the speed of this library.
