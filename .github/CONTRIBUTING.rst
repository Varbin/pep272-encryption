How to contribute
-----------------

Thanks for reading and helping this project.

The idea behind the project is to create a library to easily create standardized libraries
for symmetric ciphers. If you know anything which brings it close to the perfect library 
please tell.

Some important resources (or just one):

 - `PEP-272 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0272/>`_

Submitting changes
------------------

Please open a `Pull Request <https://github.com/varbin/pep272-encryption/pull/new/master>`_.
Tests for your code are great - they make it easier to remain quality.


Thanks,
